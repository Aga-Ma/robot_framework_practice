# robot_framework_practice
RF practice repository for LinkedIn course 
[Robot Framework Test Automation: Level 1 (Selenium)](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/robot-framework-test-automation-level-1-selenium-21986416)

## Notes
This repository mixes procedural and behavior driven development approach as it was just for practice and there was 
no reason for separate repositories creation. Hence, that causes some robot code duplication. And I can live with that
as it is created only for training purpose. I would never do something like this in the actual project.

In addition, I am in favor of separating page objects and related assertions, but resigned from refactoring as it was
the course goal.
